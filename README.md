#  ZenSocial

ZenSocial is the community platform for **ZenCommunity**. It ships a modern three-column social UI (dark theme with the signature Zen-green) and a simple Write-to-Earn model so creators can see value from engagement.

**Access**: You can only **log in with a minted ZenID**. No other login methods are enabled.

## üìå Overview

**What it is**: A fast, minimal Social / SocialFi MVP where users post, interact, message (demo), view notifications, manage profile, and see Earn totals.

**How you log in**: Mint a ZenID ‚Üí use that ZenID to sign in.

**What‚Äôs special**: A transparent Write-to-Earn formula that converts engagement into $ZTC.

**Write-to-Earn** (current formula, in $ZTC)

**earnings** = likes * 0.01 + comments * 0.02 + reposts * 0.05
